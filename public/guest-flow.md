A shopping cart is automatically created when you log in guest customer.<br/>
Here are the available actions:

### 1. Get shopping cart data

```ts
await customerClient.getShoppingCart();

Add an item to the cart by specifying the item ID and quantity:

```ts
await customerClient.addShoppingCartItem(1, { amount: 5 });
```

### 3. Remove item from cart

Remove a specific quantity of an item from the cart:

```ts
