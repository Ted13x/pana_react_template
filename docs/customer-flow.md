# Customer Flow

## üîê Authentication

### 1. Connect to the Store API

Use your store's API token to initialize the client:

```ts
const storeClient = new PanaStoreClient(apiToken);
```

### 2. Register a customer:

You can register either an individual or a company.
Make sure to include all required customPropertyValues specified by your store settings.

#### 1. Register an Individual.

 ```ts
await storeClient.register({
  email: 'customer@gmail.com',
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  phone: '+1234567890',
  password: 'johnspassword',
  customerType: 'individual',
  customPropertyValues: [
    {
      propertyId: 1,
      value: 'Blue'
    }
  ]
});
 ```

For companies, you must additionally provide:
<ul>
    <li>companyName</li>
